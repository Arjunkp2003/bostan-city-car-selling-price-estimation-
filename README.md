Model Description:

This regression model is designed to predict the selling price of cars based on various features that describe their condition, specifications, and history. Two algorithms will be applied:

Linear Regression: A simple and interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the selling price.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: An advanced ensemble algorithm that builds decision trees sequentially to minimize the error, capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships.
Target Variable:

Selling Price: A continuous variable representing the price at which the car is sold.
Features:

Year: The year of manufacturing (indicating car age).
Mileage: Fuel efficiency of the car.
Engine/Power: Engine capacity or power output.
Fuel Type: Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG).
Transmission: Type of transmission (Manual or Automatic).
Owner: Number of previous owners.
Other relevant features from the dataset (e.g., brand, model).
Steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., Fuel Type, Transmission) using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Feature Engineering:

Model Training:

Linear Regression: Train a simple regression model to establish a baseline for performance.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: Train a more complex regression model using libraries such as XGBoost, LightGBM, or scikit-learn's Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Model Evaluation:

Compare the models using regression metrics such as:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Evaluate the models on a test set to assess generalization performance.
